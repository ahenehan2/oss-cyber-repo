# OSS Cybersecurity – Public Repository

## Purpose
This public repository is part of a GitHub test organization created to support our capstone project investigating organization-level security controls, specifically SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with our institution’s Identity Provider (IdP).

The public repository is intended to represent a realistic open-source–style environment and serves as a contrast to our private internal repository. Maintaining both allows us to evaluate access boundaries, contributor workflows, and authentication behavior under enforced SAML SSO.

## Sprint 1 Scope
During Sprint 1, work on this repository was intentionally limited. The primary focus was understanding repository structure, visibility, and how public-facing repositories fit into an organization with SAML SSO enabled. I synced my fork with the upstream organization repository to ensure I was working with the most up-to-date version and to familiarize myself with a fork-based workflow.

Most hands-on testing and experimentation involving this repository is planned for Sprint 2, once the foundational setup and access validation are complete.

## Notes
This repository will be used more actively in future sprints to explore contributor experience, access behavior, and security implications in a public repository under organization-level SAML enforcement.
